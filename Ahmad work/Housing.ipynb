    "Note: You may find little differences between the code outputs in the book and in these Jupyter notebooks: these slight differences are mostly due to the random nature of many training algorithms: although I have tried to make these notebooks' outputs as constant as possible, it is impossible to guarantee that they will produce the exact same output on every platform. Also, some data structures (such as dictionaries) do not preserve the item order. Finally, I fixed a few minor bugs (I added notes next to the concerned cells) which lead to slightly different results, without changing the ideas presented in the book.\n",
